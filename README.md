Task application

## Notes for reviewers:
This repository represents a basic implementation of a given task, I have cut some corners mainly in terms of UI to conserve time.
Here's a list of things that could be improved in future:
- Unit tests
- Some abstract interfaces could be moved to a separate module to promote cleaner architechture
- Integration of a DI framework like Hilt instead of manual DI
- Better error handling with proper reporting to UI with alert dialogs
- Richer UI with thoughtout design
- RESTful image API integration
